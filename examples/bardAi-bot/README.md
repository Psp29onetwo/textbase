# Bard AI Bot

A bot using bardAi developed using a textbase framework.

 <br />

## Installation
---
Make sure you have `python version >=3.9.0`, it's always good to follow the [docs](https://docs.textbase.ai/) üëàüèª
### 1. Follow the installation steps in the [documentation of the textbase](https://docs.textbase.ai/get-started/installation)üëàüèª or alternatively just 1pip install -r requirements.txt` but make sure you get your virtual env running before installing from the file.

### 2. Give the `main.py` of this bardAi while running the project.

### 3. If you are using the `textbase-bot` repo for the front end make sure to replace the API URL as mentioned in the `textbase-bot`repository.

 <br />

## Usage
---
Make sure you have Bard AI opened in the browser
### 1. BardAi doesn't provide API key publically i need to fetch it from developer tools of the cookie section of the browser.
### 9. There is __Secure-1PSID under Bard cookies. need to delete cookies and relogin if the backend is giving errors just like we are having.


Refer to this [video link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZDqygsWxe2S_aA60u1ZrxIZhL09uGKjx/view?usp=sharing) for more ideas from configuring the API key to deploying the bot to textbase website I have recorded them all.


There are known corrections and future modifications to this project feel free to contribute if you want to.
- [X] Native integration of other models (BardAi)
- [ ] Need to display the responses as Google Brad displays with images and links on images as well.

## Demo
---
I'm sure this will not work because the API key must have expired when you are watching this repo but here is a link.
